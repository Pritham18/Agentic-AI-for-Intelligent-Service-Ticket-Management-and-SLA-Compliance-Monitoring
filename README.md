## Introduction  

### About Secure AgenticAI  

Agentic AI is a probabilistic technology that can adapt well to events and settings that change over time. As contrast to deterministic systems, like Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which adhere to set rules and predetermined results, it bases its judgments and actions on patterns and likelihoods. Many workflows and commercial processes that deterministic computers have not been able to handle on their own can now be automated thanks to agentic AI.
